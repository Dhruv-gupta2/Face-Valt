# Face-Valt
**FaceVault** is a full-stack AI face recognition system built with Python, Flask, and React. It registers and recognizes multiple faces using 128-D encodings, confidence scoring, and a REST API. Faces are stored persistently in SQLite, with a responsive UI and scalable, Docker-ready architecture.
